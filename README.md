# HeartRisk-Demographic-Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing health and demographic data to identify key traits and risk factors associated with heart disease. By exploring variables such as BMI, age, physical activity, alcohol consumption, smoking habits, and general health, the goal is to better understand the prevalence and correlations of heart disease across different demographic groups.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis contains health and demographic variables, including information about individuals' medical history, habits (such as smoking, drinking, and physical activity), and general health assessments. It includes details about whether the individuals have been diagnosed with coronary heart disease (CHD) or myocardial infarction (MI).

## Key Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Investigated the distribution of health conditions (e.g., high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes) and demographic variables (e.g., age, education, income).
- **Visualization:** Bar charts, pie charts, histograms, and scatter plots to illustrate the relationships between different factors and heart disease.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Heatmap to analyze the correlation between continuous variables such as BMI, age, and health-related measures.
- **Comparison:** Compared the distribution of health conditions and demographic traits between individuals with and without heart disease.

## Visualizations

1. **Pie Charts & Bar Charts:** Visualized the distribution of key health conditions (e.g., high blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes) and their relation to heart disease.
2. **Histograms:** Showcased the distribution of continuous variables like BMI, mental health, physical health, and age.
3. **Count Plots:** Compared heart disease prevalence across smokers vs non-smokers, those who engage in physical activity, and heavy drinkers.
4. **Boxplots & Scatter Plots:** Highlighted relationships between continuous variables and heart disease.
5. **Correlation Heatmap:** Displayed the correlation between variables like BMI, age, physical health, and mental health.

## Results and Insights
- General Health: Individuals with poorer self-reported health have a significantly higher prevalence of heart disease.
- Age & Heart Disease: Older age groups exhibit a greater risk of heart disease, with a notable increase in heart disease cases after age 50.
- Health Conditions: Key conditions such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes were strongly linked to heart disease.
- Lifestyle Factors: Smokers and those who engage in heavy alcohol consumption showed a higher incidence of heart disease, while individuals who engage in regular physical 
  activity displayed lower risks.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into the demographic and health-related factors that are associated with heart disease. The visualizations highlight critical relationships between variables like BMI, age, general health, and lifestyle habits. Understanding these connections can help in identifying at-risk groups and promoting preventive measures.
